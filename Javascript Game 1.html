Did you know if you drag a text document onto a web browser, it will print the contents to screen? 
<br/>
<h1>Groovy.</h1>
<p>If it's a text doc, it will print verbatim. If it's an html doc, it will print as html.</p>
<p>The console is useful because it will show errors in your JS.</p>

<canvas id="gameCanvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>

<script>

var canvas;
var canvasContext;

window.onload = function(){
  console.log("window.onload starts the script only after the page is loaded.");

  canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
  canvasContext = canvas.getContext('2d');
  canvasContext.fillStyle = 'black';
  canvasContext.fillRect(0,0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  /* in last line, 0,0 was x,y coord in top left.
     canvas.width, canvas.height was x,y in bottom right -- ie, 800, 600
     it's the reverse of classical math coords */
  /* this next bit is an example of using coords to place a rectangle:
     canvasContext.fillStyle = 'red';
     canvasContext.fillRect(100,200,50,25); */
  /* note that the first two numbers say where it starts
     and the last two say its size */
  canvasContext.fillStyle = 'orange';
  canvasContext.fillRect(300,250,200,100);
  canvasContext.fillStyle = 'blue';
  canvasContext.fillRect(350,300,200,100);
  /* later shapes sit on top of earlier shapes if they overlap */
  canvasContext.fillStyle = 'white';
  canvasContext.fillRect(canvas.width/2,canvas.height/3,200,100);
